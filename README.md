# üìö **Nvidia Tweaking Utility**
- Simple tool to enchance your performance focused on competitive gameplay.
## ‚öíÔ∏è **How to use it?**
- First you have to know that you will need an debloated driver. If you already have one you can skip and go to next section.
- You can easly debloat your driver with tools like [NVClean Install](https://www.techpowerup.com/nvcleanstall/), [NVSlimmer](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/nvslimmer-nvidia-driver-slimming-utility.423072/)
- All you need is: DisplayDriver, NvContainer, PhysX and possibly HD Audio (Audio via HDMI cable) or USB Type-C Port device (Video via usb-c cable). For laptops its recommended to add also NVIDIA Platform Controllers
### **Usage**
- Just run the script with the administrator privelieges, select your graphic card, and enable the tweaks. All done!
- If your temperature is too high after tweaks you can simply fix this choosing the second option.
#### Updates
- Probably there will be no update due to that script fetching files from this repository so tweaks will always be up to date.
